# filter-suspicious-players

This is a work-in-progress package that retrieves training data from the (lichess.org open database)[https://database.lichess.org/], then trains a statistical model to detect suspicious players.

Currently the app is not functional, and has not been deployed. If cloning this repo for personal use, the structure of the python scripts assumes that there is a folder called `lichess-games-database` to which .pgn and .pgn.zst files are downloaded and unzipped(this may be automated in the future using a bash script), that there is a folder called `lichess_player_data` to which .csv files are saved (this can be incorporated into parse_pgn.py by creating this folder if it does not exist), and that there is a folder called `exploratory_plots` to which plotly figures are saved (this can also be incorporated into exploratory_plots.py by creating this folder if it does not exist).
